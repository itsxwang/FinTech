## 🔹 What is MACD?

MACD indicator also called Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), is a **trend-following momentum indicator** that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price(security's price means the value of the stock at a specific point in time).

Formula:

$$
\text{MACD Line} = EMA_{12} - EMA_{26}
$$

* **EMA(12)** = faster moving average (reacts quickly).
* **EMA(26)** = slower moving average (smoother trend).

Then:

$$
\text{Signal Line} = EMA_{9}(\text{MACD Line})
$$

And:

$$
\text{Histogram} = \text{MACD Line} - \text{Signal Line}
$$

## 🔹 What it Shows

1. **Trend Direction** → if MACD > 0, momentum is bullish (short-term EMA > long-term EMA).
2. **Trend Strength** → histogram height shows how strong the move is.
3. **Reversals** → crossovers indicate potential buy/sell points.

## 🔹 How to Read MACD

1. **Line Crossovers**

   * When **MACD Line crosses above Signal Line** → **Bullish** (buy signal).
   * When **MACD Line crosses below Signal Line** → **Bearish** (sell signal).

2. **Zero Line Cross**

   * MACD above 0 → bullish trend.
   * MACD below 0 → bearish trend.

3. **Histogram**

   * Bars growing taller = momentum increasing.
   * Bars shrinking = momentum weakening.

4. **Divergence**

   * If price makes new high but MACD doesn’t = **bearish divergence** (trend weakening).
   * If price makes new low but MACD doesn’t = **bullish divergence** (trend weakening).

## 🔹 Practical Example (SOLUSDT)

* If on **1H chart**, MACD line crosses **above signal line** while histogram flips from negative to positive → momentum is shifting bullish = good entry point.
* If you’re already in trade and histogram starts shrinking while price still going up → momentum is weakening, maybe time to exit or tighten stop-loss.

## 🔹 Quant Intuition

Think of MACD like:

* **Momentum Oscillator** (captures speed of trend).
* **Differential Engine** (MACD is literally “first derivative” of moving averages).
* A “smoothed” way to measure **when momentum accelerates or decelerates**.

---

⚡ In short:

* **MACD Line & Signal Cross** = entry/exit timing.
* **Histogram** = strength of move.
* **Zero Line** = overall trend bias.
