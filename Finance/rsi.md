Perfect question â€” letâ€™s break **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** down the way a **quant** would think about it.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is RSI?

RSI = **Relative Strength Index**, a **bounded oscillator** (values between 0 and 100) that measures the **speed & magnitude of recent price changes**.

* High RSI ( > 70 ) â†’ asset is considered **overbought** (possible reversal down).
* Low RSI ( < 30 ) â†’ asset is considered **oversold** (possible reversal up).

Itâ€™s a **momentum indicator**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Formula (Quant View)

For a lookback period $n$ (usually 14 days):

1. Compute **daily returns** (price differences).
2. Separate **gains** and **losses**:

$$
\text{Gain}_t = \max(\Delta P_t, 0), \quad \text{Loss}_t = \max(-\Delta P_t, 0)
$$

3. Take the **exponential moving average (EMA)** or simple average over $n$:

$$
\text{AvgGain} = \frac{\sum \text{Gain}_t}{n}, \quad \text{AvgLoss} = \frac{\sum \text{Loss}_t}{n}
$$

4. Compute **Relative Strength (RS)**:

$$
RS = \frac{\text{AvgGain}}{\text{AvgLoss}}
$$

5. Compute RSI:

$$
RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1+RS}
$$

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Quantitative Interpretation

* RSI is basically a **bounded transformation** of the ratio of *average up moves* to *average down moves*.
* It normalizes momentum into **\[0, 100]**, making it easier to use in rule-based strategies.
* In quant terms, RSI is a **nonlinear, bounded function of rolling returns** â†’ a signal.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. How Quants Use RSI

1. **Trading Rules (Classic)**:

   * Buy if RSI < 30 (oversold).
   * Sell if RSI > 70 (overbought).

2. **Contrarian Quant Strategy**:

   * RSI < 20 â†’ extreme pessimism â†’ mean reversion buy.
   * RSI > 80 â†’ extreme optimism â†’ mean reversion sell.

3. **Momentum/Trend-Following Strategy**:

   * RSI > 50 = bullish regime, stay long.
   * RSI < 50 = bearish regime, stay short.

4. **Quant Tweaks**:

   * Optimize lookback window (n = 7, 14, 21).
   * Combine with volatility filters (only trade signals when volatility is low).
   * Use RSI as a feature in **machine learning models** instead of a standalone rule.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Limitations (Quantâ€™s Skepticism)

* RSI is a **lagging indicator** (based on past returns).
* Works well in **range-bound markets**, but fails in **trending markets** (youâ€™ll sell too early or buy too soon).
* Many traders use it, so the **edge is weak unless combined with other signals**.

---

âœ… So, in quant language:
**RSI is a nonlinear, bounded transformation of return ratios that acts as a normalized momentum signal.**
Itâ€™s useful as a **feature** in a strategy or model, but fragile as a **standalone alpha source**.
